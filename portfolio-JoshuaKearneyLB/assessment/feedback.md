## 0. Practicals and Exercises

* I completed 3 of each of the weekly tasks from the portfolio. I picked the 3 tasks that appeared more challenging to me,
and all the tasks I did attempt work to a good standard and I have included validation in some programs but not all.    

* Some work in the exercises have been completed as a group with other students within 
the class and my tutor collectively 

## 1. Task 1: Pizza Prices

* This is my best program. It was the easiest of the 3, and I structured my code in a clear format using functions for each
section of the calculation for this app. Calculation was done step by step ensuring no arithmetic/logic errors and the program
contains full validation.

## 2. Task 2: The Cat Shelter

* This program works correctly, properly displaying the total times in the format requested by the user/assignment brief.
It takes a single command line argument which is the file name and I found it quite easy.

## 3. Task 3: Managing Passwords

* I have fully completed the program allowing for adding users, deleting users, logging in and changing the password.
The system is designed so that one python file (module) contains all of my functions and the other files will call to that one.
When a password is being entered in any of the programs the echo is completely hidden. Also, the file where passwords and users are stored is
taken as a command line argument. The most difficult one but by far the one I liked doing the most.
